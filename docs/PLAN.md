# Prototype plan — Phase 1 ("manual farm")

Question this prototype must answer: in the first 5–10 minutes, is the manual loop
plant → water → harvest → sell, under an energy limit, fun enough that the player
*wants* a sprinkler? If not, stop and fix the loop before Phase 2.

## Scope
**In:** 6 tiles, 2 crops (fast/cheap; slow/expensive behind a license), till/plant/water/harvest,
energy + regen, moisture bar, on-field rot, instant sell (no inventory), 3 upgrades
(energy max, energy regen, buy tile 7–8), localStorage save, offline catch-up (cap 8 h).

**Out:** workers, machines, dynamic market, inventory spoilage, loans, prestige, art.

## Stack
Vite + TypeScript + React, Vitest. Package manager: pnpm. Repo: this directory.

## Layout
```
src/
  core/            # pure TS, never imports React or DOM
    state.ts       # RunState / MetaState (run/meta split), GameState = { run, meta }
    step.ts        # step(state, ticks): moisture drains, crops grow while moist, energy regen, rot past grace
    actions.ts     # till/plant/water/harvest/sell/buyUpgrade/buyLicense/buyTile — return new state or a typed error
    balance.ts     # every tunable number lives here, read through multiplier fns
    data/crops.ts, data/upgrades.ts
  app/             # React: FarmGrid, Hud (cash/energy), Shop
  save/            # serialize/deserialize + schema version + offline catch-up
tests/
  *.test.ts        # per-action tests + sim.test.ts (bot plays 600 ticks)
docs/              # PRD.md, DECISIONS.md, PLAN.md
```

## Tasks (in order)
1. Scaffold Vite + React + TS + Vitest; eslint; scripts `dev` / `build` / `test` / `lint`. Commit.
2. `core/state.ts` + `core/balance.ts` + `core/data/*` — data model and all starting values.
3. `core/step.ts` — tick logic, with tests (grow only while moist, regen caps at max, rot after grace).
4. `core/actions.ts` — 4 manual actions + sell + buy upgrade/license/tile; one test file per action group; errors are values, not throws.
5. `tests/sim.test.ts` — greedy bot plays 600 ticks: cash never negative, crop-2 license affordable within ~300 ticks (target, tune `balance.ts` until it passes and report the final numbers).
6. React UI: 6-tile grid (colour/emoji per state), click tile → next sensible action, HUD, Shop. Mobile-width friendly.
7. Save/load (localStorage, versioned) + offline catch-up (step missed seconds, cap 8 h), tested with a fake clock.
8. Deploy to GitHub Pages (Vite `base`, `gh-pages` or Actions workflow).
9. Playtest together in the Discord thread → record verdict + tuned numbers in `docs/PLAYTEST.md`.

Tasks 1–5 are batch 1; 6–8 batch 2. Each batch = one commit series on `main` (prototype repo,
no branch ceremony yet).

## Rules for the implementer
- `src/core/**` must stay free of React/DOM imports; add an eslint `no-restricted-imports` rule or a test that asserts it.
- All numbers in `balance.ts`. If you need a number elsewhere, add it there first.
- Do not start a dev server in headless runs; `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` are the proof.
- Keep `docs/DECISIONS.md` authoritative; if you must deviate, write the deviation and reason into `docs/PLAN.md` under "Deviations".

## Deviations
- **Harvest sells instantly; there is no `sell` action.** With no inventory in Phase 1, `harvest` credits the
  crop's sell price straight to cash and leaves the tile tilled. A separate sell step would only cost a click.
